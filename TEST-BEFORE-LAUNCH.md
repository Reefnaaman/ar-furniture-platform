# 🚀 Test Before Launch - MVP Readiness Checklist

## Critical Path Testing
- [ ] **Database Init**: Visit `/api/init-db` to ensure all tables exist
- [ ] **Upload Flow**: Test GLB upload → verify shareable link generation
- [ ] **AR View**: Test generated links on real iPhone/Android devices (not browser simulation)
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test invalid files, oversized files, network failures

## Infrastructure Verification
- [ ] **Vercel Environment Variables**: Confirm all secrets are properly set
- [ ] **Domain SSL**: Verify HTTPS works on `newfurniture.live`
- [ ] **Cloudinary Integration**: Test actual file upload and retrieval

## Mobile Reality Check (Critical for AR)
- [ ] **AR Camera Launch**: Verify AR activates immediately on mobile
- [ ] **No Middleware Screens**: Ensure no color/variant selection blocks iPhone AR consent
- [ ] **Model Loading**: Confirm GLB files load and place correctly in AR view
- [ ] **Cross-Platform**: Test on both iOS Safari and Android Chrome

## Error Message Audit (User-Friendly Review)
All error messages must be clear, friendly, and actionable for end users.

### ❌ Current Error Messages That Need Review:

**API Error Messages (Backend):**
- [ ] `"Rate limit exceeded"` → ✅ Good (includes retry time)
- [ ] `"No file provided"` → ✅ Good
- [ ] `"Only GLB and GLTF files are allowed"` → ✅ Good 
- [ ] `"File too large. Maximum size is 100MB"` → ✅ Good
- [ ] `"Failed to fetch models"` → ⚠️ Generic, could be more specific
- [ ] `"Model not found"` → ✅ Good
- [ ] `"Invalid credentials"` → ✅ Good
- [ ] `"Username and password are required"` → ✅ Good
- [ ] `"Failed to save model to database"` → ⚠️ Technical, scary for users
- [ ] `"Internal server error"` → ⚠️ Generic, not helpful

**Client-Side Alert Messages:**
- [ ] `"AR not supported on this device"` → ✅ Good
- [ ] `"Please select a GLB or GLTF file"` → ✅ Good
- [ ] `"File size must be less than 100MB"` → ✅ Good
- [ ] `"Upload failed: [error]"` → ⚠️ Shows technical errors to users
- [ ] `"Failed to load furniture collection"` → ⚠️ Generic
- [ ] `"Please provide a product URL"` → ✅ Good
- [ ] `"Image size must be less than 2MB"` → ✅ Good
- [ ] `"Please upload a PNG or JPG image"` → ✅ Good

**HTML Error Display:**
- [ ] Error containers show raw error messages from API
- [ ] Stack traces appear in development mode
- [ ] No loading states for error scenarios

### ✅ Error Messages Improved:
**Key improvements made:**
- Technical database errors → "Unable to complete upload at this time. Please try again in a few moments."
- Generic "Failed to fetch" → "Unable to load your furniture models. Please refresh the page and try again."
- "Internal server error" → "Something went wrong on our end. Please try again in a few moments."
- Upload errors → "Upload couldn't complete. Please check your file and try again."

### 🔧 Remaining Improvements for Future:
1. **Add loading states** during operations
2. **Add retry buttons** for recoverable errors
3. **Toast notifications** instead of alerts for better UX
